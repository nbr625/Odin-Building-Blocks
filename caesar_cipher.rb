# Exercise from Odin-Project - http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/building-blocks

## Takes a string and encrypts the message by shifting the placement of the individual characters
## by the number indicated on the second argument, "shift". The focus of this approach was to be as
## pithy and clear as possible. That is the sort of style that I deign "beautiful".
## A historical treat:Julius Ceasar used this encryption to send war missives along, in case they
## were to be intercepted. 
## Enjoy!
